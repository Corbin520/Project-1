# Project-1

This was my first class Project. Together my group and I created a site that allows you to find activities and food near park city. Our goal is to make this site available to all areas. Thought we only had a week and a half, I am very satisfied with our work.

In this assignment, I was over the back end. I worked on the API's, Javascript and the Database. I also worked on the Summer and Winter page. As you can see, the weather is at the top of each page, this is an API that I pulled from a weather site, stored it in the DB and returned it to he page. It updates the page everytime the weather API page updates their site.

The second API that was used was the Yelp API. As you can see on the actvitie pages, there is an average review of the activity as well as a customer comment. If you go in the console, you can see the API and what it pulls from Yelp's site.
